This app is intended to be used with the COMET-Planner Tool, which can be used to investigate how CO2 sequestration and GHG production will change as the use of working and natural lands changes. The various practices that can be compared within the tool are based on NRCS Conservation Practices.


The inputs required in the COMET-Planner Tool are the county in which the conservation practice will be implemented, the type of practice being assessed (options provided within the COMET-Planner Tool), and the acreage of interest.


This app, aims to assist the user in identifying the acrege of interest, within the South Platte River Basin of Colorado. Currently, it simply returns the acres of irrigated agriculture within an area of interst (from a shape file) and the owner (e.g., 'Private', 'City', 'State').


Possible future functionality includes filtering by non-irrigated land, irrigated land, or both, filtering by highly disturbed land, by riparian area, the ability to upload a zipped shape file, and more.


Currently, three areas of interest are already uploaded so that you can try the tool. To upload your own area of interest, you need to upload each of the files that is associated with an esri shape (.shp) file (i.e., .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .sbn, .sbx, .shp)
